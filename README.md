# Adaboost

Assumption: The code assumes that the target class of the dataset has attributes [1,-1]. '1' stands for malicious executables and '-1' stands for benign executables.

We have a dataset consisting of bigrams (as features) of malicious executables. Our aim is to find the increase in accuracy achieved by boosting technique (Adaboost). 

Function Input Parameters: The predictions given by three weak learners and the correct target class values.
